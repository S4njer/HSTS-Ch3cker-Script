# HSTS-Ch3cker-Script
This Bash script allows you to check for the presence of "HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)" in a list of IP addresses. It performs repeated curl requests for both HTTP and HTTPS connections to each IP address and saves the results in a file. The script also applies colors to the output messages using ANSI escape sequences.
